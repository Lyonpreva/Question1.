1.A.)Algorithm: It's a series of steps required to carry out an action. It's also a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.
      def fxn(k)
          a=sum(k)
          b=len(k)
          c=a/b
          print(k)
          print(type(k))
          print(a,b,c)
fxn(

B.)Pseudocode: It's an artificial and informal language that helps programmers develop algorithms.

C.)Flowchart: it's a graphical representation of a computer program in relation to its sequence of functions

D.i.)the outputs must be specified
  ii.the inputs must be specified
  iii.definitiess
  iv.effectiveness
  v. finiteness

E.)a=5
   b=10
   c="a + b"
   print(c)

F.)BEGIN
 NUMBER s1, s2, sum.
 OUTPUT("Input number1:")
 INPUT s1
 OUTPUT("Input number2:")
 INPUT s2
 sum=s1+s2
 OUTPUT sum
 END

G.)Step 1: Start
   
   Step 2: Declare variables num1, num2 and sum

   Step 3: Read values for num1, num2

   Step 4:Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to a variable sum

   Step 5: Display sum

   Step 6:
